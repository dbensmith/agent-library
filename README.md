# Agent Library

A centralized repository for AI agent instructions, skills, prompts, and documentation. This library is designed to be general-purpose and extensible, following best practices for agentic workflows.

## Directory Structure

- `instructions/`: High-level system instructions and personas.
- `skills/`: Tool definitions, schemas, and implementation guides.
- `prompts/`: Reusable prompt templates and few-shot examples.
- `docs/`: General documentation and architecture patterns.

## Best Practices

- **Modularity**: Keep instructions and skills focused on specific tasks.
- **Version Control**: Use semantic versioning or clear change logs for updates.
- **Documentation**: Always provide clear usage examples for prompts and skills.
